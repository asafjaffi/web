= Jetty-Guice-Jersey-Gson project template

This repo contains a working template for java executables, which serve self-contained 
web apps.

The server is embedded, and so are the different assets.

== How to run

1. compile a jar.

	mvn clean install

2. run the jar and get the server up

	java -jar target/web-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
	
3. get served at `localhost:8080/` and at `localhost:8080/example`.
